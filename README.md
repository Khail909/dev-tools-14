# Snake Game in Python
The game is an arcade game and it has very simple logic.
The player is represented as snake, which grows if it eats an apple. The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding into yourself. This is very easy in the early phase of the game but is increasingly more difficult as the length of the snake grows.
